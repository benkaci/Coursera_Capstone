## Optimal Restaurant Location Finder
This project used venue data from FourSquare API and geographical location from Wikipedia.
Type of restaurant left up to user preference using an input statement.
Neibourhoods were clustered based off of the frequency of venue visits, along with the type of venue using K-means supervised learning algorithm. 
The optimal number of clusters was found using the elbow method.
Neighbourhoods were selected from the cluster with the highest mean frequency.
Amount of restaurants versus the frequency of visits per neighbourhood was then analyzed to find the best potential neighbourhood to open a restaurant.
